# vfront
VFront is a free, open source front-end for MySQL or PostgreSQL databases written in PHP and Javascript.

Please check out the great work marciuz and Co have done on this project. 

I have forked this because I have made a docker image for vFront which I will post in a bit. I want to automate as much of the installation in the Docker image as possible so there might be some tweaks here and there.
